# Inception
Docker is a platform that enables developers to easily pack, ship, and run applications as lightweight, portable containers. These containers are isolated environments that contain everything needed to run the application, including the code, runtime, system tools, and libraries. Docker simplifies the deployment process by ensuring consistency across different environments, from development to production.

# Docker

## Image
An image is a read-only template used to create containers. It contains the filesystem and runtime configuration of an application. Images are built from Dockerfiles using the docker build command or pulled from Docker registries like Docker Hub using the docker pull command.

## Container
A container is a runnable instance of an image. It encapsulates the application and its dependencies, along with runtime configuration, and runs in an isolated environment. Containers can be started, stopped, and managed using Docker commands like docker run, docker stop, and docker rm.ontainers

## Docker Volume
Volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. They provide a way to share data between containers, and between the host machine and containers. Docker volumes can be managed using the docker volume command or specified in Docker Compose files.

## Docker commands

# Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text document that contains instructions for building a Docker image. These instructions define the environment inside the container, including the base image, dependencies, environment variables, and commands to run when the container starts. Dockerfiles provide a reproducible and automated way to create consistent Docker images, making it easy to share and deploy applications across different environments.

| `RUN`           | Execute commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results |
| `COPY`          | Copy files or directories from the host to the container's filesystem |
| `ADD`           | Similar to COPY but can also fetch URLs and extract TAR files |
| `WORKDIR`       | Set the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow it |
| `CMD`           | Provide defaults for executing a container, which can be overridden by command-line arguments |
| `ENTRYPOINT`    | Configure a container to run as an executable |
| `EXPOSE`        | Expose ports to allow communication between the container and the outside world |

| `LABEL`         | Add metadata to an image |
| `ONBUILD`       | Add triggers to be executed at a later time when another image is built using the current image as its base |
| `STOPSIGNAL`    | Set the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit |

| `SHELL`         | Override the default shell used for executing commands |

# Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to define the services, networks, and volumes required for an application and allows you to start, stop, and manage the entire application stack with a single command. Docker Compose simplifies the orchestration of complex applications by providing a declarative syntax for defining the application configuration and automating common tasks like container linking and network setup.

```
services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest  # Specifies the Docker image to use for the service.
    container_name: web_container  # Sets the name of the container.
    ports:  # Exposes ports from the container to the host system.
      - "8080:80"  # Maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on the host.
    volumes:  # Specifies volumes to mount into the container.
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf  # Mounts the local nginx.conf file into the container.
    networks:  # Defines which networks the service should be connected to.
      - frontend  # Connects to the frontend network.
      - backend   # Connects to the backend network.
    depends_on:  # Specifies dependencies between services.
      - db  # Indicates that the web service depends on the db service.
```
